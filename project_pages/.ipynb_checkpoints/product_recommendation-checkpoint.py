    # Step 2: Load Sentence-BERT model for vectorization
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Step 3: Convert product descriptions to vectors
    product_vectors = model.encode(descriptions)
    # This step converts textual product descriptions into numerical vectors using a pre-trained model
    # In this case, the model is a Sentence-BERT model (which was initialized earlier with SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2'))
    
    # Sentence-BERT is a variant of the BERT model that is fine-tuned to generate embeddings for sentences or texts
    # It transforms each product description into a fixed-size vector that captures the semantic meaning of the sentence

    # The result (product_vectors) is a list of vectors, one for each product description
    # Each vector represents the meaning of the corresponding product description in a high-dimensional space
    
    # Step 4: Normalize vectors (FAISS recommends normalizing vectors)
    product_vectors = np.array([vec / np.linalg.norm(vec) for vec in product_vectors])
    # This step normalizes the vectors to ensure they all have unit length (i.e., their magnitude or length is 1)
    # This is recommended for similarity searches to ensure that the comparison focuses only on the direction of the vectors, not their magnitude
    
    # Step 5: Create FAISS index
    d = product_vectors.shape[1]  # get dimension of the vector embeddings
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)   # FAISS will use this to compute L2 Eucledian distance between vectors during the search process
    index.add(product_vectors)     # adds the normalized product vectors to the FAISS index. After this, the index is ready for performing similarity searches
    # FAISS is being used here to efficiently perform nearest-neighbor search based on vector similarity
    # This step initializes a FAISS index using Euclidean distance (L2) to measure similarity between vectors
